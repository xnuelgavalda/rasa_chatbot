## General Information
The goal of this project is to build, implement and deploy a python chatbot using Rasa (https://rasa.com/).

A chatbot is an application that can initiate and continue a conversation using auditory and/or textual methods as a human would do.
A chatbot can be either a simple rule-based engine or an intelligent application leveraging Natural Language Understanding. 
Many organizations today have started using chatbots extensively. Chatbots are becoming famous as they are available 24x7, 
provide a consistent customer experience, can handle several customers at a time, are cost-effective and hence, results in a 
better overall customer experience.

A chatbot can be used for the following purposes: 
- Customer support
- Frequently Asked Questions
- Addressing Grievances
- Appointment Booking
- Automation of routine tasks
- Address a query
